    "gameBlurb": "Once, in a quiet village, there lived a kind-hearted girl named Elara. She was deeply in love - a love so pure, even the stars seemed to watch. But jealousy breeds cruelty, and one fateful night, a bitter enchantress cast a terrible curse. With a single spell, Elara was shrunken to the size of an insect - doomed to wander unseen in a world that once felt safe.\n\n'Only true love's kiss shall break the curse,' the sorceress whispered. 'But first... the girl must survive the Garden of Trials.'\n\nNow, her home garden has become a sprawling labyrinth. Every blade of grass is a towering wall, every pebble a mountain. A cat stalks her every move, ants swarm in her path, and a monstrous centipede lurks in the dark.\n\nElara: Garden of Trials is a survival-adventure platformer that blends thrill, beauty, and moral depth. Guide Elara through a world that is both breathtaking and brutal. Face her fears, uncover the lessons hidden in the soil, and fight for the love that could break her curse.\n\nWill you help her find her way back, or will she be lost forever in the garden she once called home?",
